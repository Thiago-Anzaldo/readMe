# GACHA-DEX

Hello! We are **Los Amiguitos** and we present **Gacha-Dex**, a project that lets you explore the world of Pokémon in a fun and interactive way.  

With **Gacha-Dex**, you can:  
- Roll for Pokémon and collect them.  
- Get Pokémon in **normal** or **shiny** form.  
- Benefit from a **pity system**: the more pity you have, the higher the chance of getting a **LEGENDARY** or **SHINY** Pokémon.  
- Track your progress in a **Pokédex** that fills up as you collect Pokémon.  
- Show off your Pokémon in an **inventory**, featuring both normal and shiny forms, and mark your favorites.
